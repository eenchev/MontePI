# MontePI
Rough Python implementation of a Monte Carlo method to estimate the value of π


## How it Works

This is a simple demonstration of a bruteforce method. The script takes as an input a number for points to generate and outputs π estimation. Its terminal and graphical outputs can be seen in the following screenshot:

## TODO

There is a lot to be desired:

* Better coding style. Maybe and OOP solution?
* Optimization can be done on the data structures used.
* The use of matplotlib limits the graphing capabilities. Maximum number of points displayed is as of now 1000. 

Feel free to contribute.
